This repo contains the code I used in my MSc project to learn the vehicle dynamics of a simulated rover over some terrain which was generated from a real data set. The original thesis can be downloaded from - https://www.kesterbroatch.com/assets/terrain-learning-vehicle/Learning_Vehicle_Dynamics_Models_by_Self_Supervised_Learning.pdf
